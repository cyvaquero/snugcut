# SnugCut

Nest SVG and DXF parts onto sheets for laser, vinyl, CNC and plasma cutters, in one HTML file. Open
[`snugcut.html`](snugcut.html) in a browser (double-click is fine): no install, no build, no server.
Everything runs in the page; your files are never uploaded (see [Files](#files) for the library and font requests). It needs a current desktop browser (Chrome or Edge, Firefox 101+,
Safari 16.4+); those versions are known API support, not tested minimums.

Two modes:

- **True shape** (default): parts interlock by their real outlines and can rotate (none / 180 / 90 / 45 / 30 / 15°).
  Spacing envelopes → no-fit polygons → first-fit on multiple plates, improved by a seeded search: an order walk by
  default, or a genetic search ("Search 30 s more", Stop). The search runs in a background worker, so the page stays
  responsive; the **Workers** setting adds up to 3 more.
- **Bounding box**: MaxRects packing (4 heuristics × 5 sort orders) with optional 90° rotation, then a swap search on the
  best order: seeded tries that swap two parts or change the heuristic, run until a fixed amount of packing work is
  spent (counted in free-rectangle comparisons, not time) or 30,000 tries have run (about 350 ms for the sample parts,
  under half a second for thousands of parts or a few plate-sized ones), so the same parts and settings give the same layout on any machine.

**Outline precision** (True shape; Standard 0.25 mm or Fine 0.1 mm) sets how closely the outline used for nesting
follows each part. Rounded rectangles nest by their rounded corners and `<use>` copies by the shapes they copy; text,
images and copies of a `<symbol>` nest by the box around them. It changes only the spacing, never the cut paths. Very complex outlines are simplified further,
always outward, so they nest a little less tightly but never overlap.

**Area minimum** is the fewest plates the job could fit on by area alone: in True shape, the parts' envelopes
(outlines plus half the spacing all round, less the holes of parts set to nest other parts inside them) divided by the
plate's usable area grown by half the spacing (and the outline precision); in Bounding box mode, the parts' bounding
rectangles grown by the spacing, divided by the usable area grown the same way. When the best layout uses more plates
than that, the status line suggests a longer search ("A longer search may save a plate").

**Utilization** (each plate, and the average over all plates) is the share of the plate covered by the parts' real
material: their outlines minus their holes, in both modes (parts kept as original markup count their holes as
material).

**Efficiency** rates the whole job from 1 to 10: the parts' real material divided by the material the job uses up,
with the percentage next to it. Full plates count whole; the last plate counts only up to one straight cut just past
its parts, across its width or its height, whichever leaves the larger offcut, and that offcut's size is shown on the
last plate (when it's at least 10 mm across). Nesting parts inside holes raises it. Part shapes cap it: round parts can't cover a plate the way
rectangles can, so a well-nested job of discs still rates lower than one of rectangles.

After any change to the parts or settings, the plates on screen are dimmed and can't be downloaded until the new
layout is ready. While a search is running it can replace the layout at any moment, so single plates of a
multi-plate job can't be downloaded until it ends or you press Stop; **Download all** works throughout and takes every
plate from the same layout.

SVG sizes come from `width`/`height` (mm, cm, in, pt, pc, px at the set DPI) and the `viewBox`. When their aspect
ratios differ, the drawing is scaled the way browsers scale it (`preserveAspectRatio`: fit by default, fill for
`slice`, stretch only for `none`); shapes are never cropped.

DXF files (ASCII, any version) are read directly: lines, arcs, circles, ellipses, (LW)polylines with bulges,
splines and block inserts (scaled, rotated, mirrored, arrays) from model space, in the drawing's units (`$INSUNITS`).
Files that don't declare their units (most R12 files) are read as mm, or as inches when their
`$MEASUREMENT` header says imperial; a notice says which, and a **Drawn in** menu next to the part switches it between
mm and inches. Each DXF color becomes a stroke color. Text, hatches and dimensions are skipped
with a notice, and so is anything on a frozen, off or non-plotting layer or the Defpoints layer. Paper space and
invisible entities are left out without a notice.

Exports one SVG per plate (sizes in mm, one object per part, unique ids) or a zip of all plates. The SVG export
format was verified in WeCreat MakeIT 3.06 (macOS) for the WeCreat Vision Pro 45W and must not change. Circles,
ellipses and arcs are written as Bézier segments of at most 45°, which stay within about 4e-6 of the radius (0.002 mm
on a 500 mm circle).

**Compensate kerf on objects** (off by default) builds the kerf into the downloaded files. Closed cut paths move by
half the kerf, outlines outward and holes inward, so parts come out at their drawn size. Filled areas and open lines
stay as drawn, and nesting spacing and margins grow to match (except around parts that are exported as drawn). Read this before using it:

- **Turn off kerf offset in your cutter's software.** The downloaded files already include it, so leaving it on
  applies the kerf twice: parts come out a full kerf too big and holes a full kerf too small.
- **Measure the kerf** for the material and settings you cut with ("Measure it from a test cut"). A wrong kerf makes
  every part the wrong size.
- **Every closed, unfilled path is treated as a cut.** A closed score or engrave outline moves too.
- **Curves become fine straight segments** (within 0.002 mm), so compensated circles aren't true arcs in a DXF.
- **Compensated files are marked** (an SVG comment, a DXF `999` comment). If one is added to SnugCut again, it
  is recognized and not compensated a second time. Parts kept as original markup and holes narrower than the kerf
  are exported as drawn (in SVG and DXF), with a notice.

**Parts kept as original markup**: a part with text, images, `<use>` copies, gradient or pattern fills, clip paths,
masks, filters or markers is exported exactly as drawn instead of as cut paths. Such a part nests by its outline only:
its kerf isn't compensated, it gets no **Nest parts inside the holes** button, its holes count as material in the
utilization, and its text, images, `<use>` copies and markers can't be written to DXF. Markers (arrowheads, dots)
get room in the outline up to their full size around the point they sit on.

**Export format: DXF** writes the same plates as DXF R12 (ASCII, mm, origin bottom-left) for CAM software that prefers
DXF. It has the same cut paths, cut order and joined outlines as the SVG. Circles and circular arcs stay true arcs
(polyline bulges), and other curves are flattened to within 0.01 mm. There is one layer per color (named by its hex
value), or per source layer for parts imported from DXF. Text, images and `<use>` copies can't be written to DXF and
are left out; filled shapes become outlines. A notice names anything that was left out.

## Settings

Settings are remembered in this browser (local storage) and restored next time.

The **Search Options** and **Plate & cutting** boxes open and close from their headings: Search Options
starts closed and Plate & cutting open, and whether each is open is remembered with the settings. A closed box shows a
one-line summary under its heading, such as "Order walk, workers off" or "300 × 300 mm, kerf 0.1 mm, SVG", which a
screen reader hears with the heading's button. Closing Plate & cutting brings the parts list up next to the results;
the mm/in switch stays in its heading, and a field error opens the box again.

- **Nesting mode**: True shape or Bounding box (top right).
- **Search Options** (True shape, its own box above Plate & cutting):
  - **Method**: **Order walk** (the default) keeps changing the order the parts are placed in, 1–3 swaps or moves at
    a time, keeps each change that is no worse, and lets every part take its best angle where it lands. **Genetic**
    keeps 20 layouts, each an order and a fixed angle per part, and breeds new ones from the best of them; with
    one angle per part each layout is quicker to try, so it tries many more in the same time. When it stops
    improving, it starts again from shaken copies of its best layout. In tests over 10 jobs (the sample parts, the
    nesting and test-cut fixtures, and a 120-part mix with and without nesting in holes, at 90° and 15° steps, 8
    seeds, 4 s and 30 s), Genetic did better than Order walk on 73 runs and worse on 22 with one worker, and better on
    74 and worse on 14 with four; it saved plates on the nesting fixtures and filled plates noticeably better at 15°
    and on the 120-part jobs. At 90° steps it can do slightly worse: in 4 s searches of the 120-part jobs with one
    worker it filled plates a little less well in most runs, and with four workers it once stayed on 2 plates for a
    4 s search where Order walk found 1. Those tests ran on 1.3.42-beta. Since 1.3.46-beta both methods try more
    layouts in the same time, Order walk the most; in 4 s searches of the same jobs with one worker
    (1.3.47-beta), Genetic did better on 33 runs and worse on 9. Both start from the same two sorted orders.
  - **Workers**: Off (the default) searches in one background worker; 2, 3 or 4 workers try that many layouts at
    once, so more layouts are tried in the same time. Each extra worker uses more memory, about 100 MB on a job of
    120 parts, so on a lower-spec computer (little memory or few processor cores) leave it off; the box says so.
    Layouts and exports don't depend on it beyond the number of layouts tried. How much it helps depends on the
    method, measured on the sample parts (1.3.47-beta): with 4 workers Order walk tries 4.2–4.9× as many
    layouts as one at 90° steps and 2–3.4× at 15°. Genetic waits at each step for the slowest of its layouts, and
    each worker builds its own cache of part pairs, so it tries 2.5–2.9× as many at 90°, 1.9× at 15° in a 30 s
    search, and no more than one worker in a 4 s search at 15°.
- **Units**: mm or in, for every length field and the sizes in the parts list. Files are always written in mm.
  Length fields take `.` or `,` as the decimal point, and numbers on screen use your browser's locale (`0,2` in
  German, for example); exported files always use `.`.
- **Plate width / height**, **Kerf**, **Extra gap**, **Edge margin**: the sheet, the width the cut removes, extra
  spacing between parts, and the empty border around the sheet. "Measure it from a test cut" works out the kerf from a
  designed and a measured size; cut that test with compensation off and no kerf offset in your cutter's software.
- **Compensate kerf on objects**: see above.
- **Rotation** (True shape): none, 180° flips, or 90°, 45°, 30° or 15° steps. **Allow 90° rotation** (Bounding box).
- **Outline precision** (True shape): see above.
- **Unitless SVG scale**: how many px make an inch in SVGs sized in px or without units: 96 (Inkscape, browsers),
  72 (Illustrator) or 90 (old Inkscape). SVG sizes in mm, cm, in, pt and pc are read as they are (and without a
  `viewBox` such a file's drawing is in CSS px, 96 per inch, as in every viewer).
- **Plate outline in export**: adds the sheet's outline as a red rectangle (SVG) or on a `PLATE` layer (DXF).
- **Output file prefix** (up to 60 characters): put in front of the file names, which are `plate-01-of-03.svg` (or `.dxf`), and
  `nested-plates.zip` without a prefix or `<prefix>-plates.zip` with one. "Download all (.zip)" appears when there is
  more than one plate.
- **Export format**: SVG, or DXF (R12, mm).

In the parts list, each file has a **quantity** (0 leaves it out), an **orientation** button, and a remove button.
The orientation button cycles through three states, each with its own icon: **free** (an open lock: the part turns at
the Rotation step), **grain** (wavy lines: the part only turns end for end, 0° or 180°, so wood grain or brushed metal
runs the same way on every copy; in Bounding box mode it isn't turned at all, since 180° gives the same rectangle), and
**locked** (a closed lock: 0° only). A part left out because it fits only turned another way says so, and a
grain part's outline on the plate preview is labeled "(grain)". A line under the parts list explains the three states. A few sample parts are loaded at first; they go away when you add your own files.

**Parts inside holes** (True shape): a part with holes gets a **Nest parts inside the holes** button (off by default;
not on parts kept as original markup);
parts without holes show a dimmed red, slashed stand-in in its place, so the list lines up.
Turned on, smaller parts can be nested in that part's holes, with the same spacing as anywhere else, and they're cut,
whole, before the part around them, so the hole's slug can't drop or shift before they're free. A hole is any closed,
unfilled outline inside the part (the rule kerf compensation uses). SnugCut can't tell a cut from a score, so turn it on
only for parts whose closed inner outlines are all cut: a part nested inside a scored outline would be cut out of the
middle of the part around it. Anything drawn inside a hole (a smaller cut, a score line) is kept clear. Utilization
counts each part's real material: a hole is empty space, whether the button is on or not, until a part is nested in
it, and then that part counts (parts kept as original markup count their holes as material).

What happens to imported files:

- Shapes a browser wouldn't show (hidden, fully transparent, or with no fill and no stroke) are left out.
- Links to anything outside the file (images, fonts, other files) are removed, so nothing is fetched. That includes
  URLs hidden in CSS custom properties: a custom property holding a string, and `var()` inside `image-set()`,
  `image()` or `cross-fade()`, are removed; custom properties holding colors or lengths keep working. Embedded
  (`data:`) content is kept only for raster images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, BMP) and fonts.
- A part with too many crossing lines to trace its outline quickly (more than 10,000 crossings, about 775 or more
  line ends meeting at one point such as a star or sunburst, or thousands of open zigzag turns) is nested by the shape
  around all of it, with a notice; its cut paths are exported as drawn.
- Limits that refuse input, each with a message saying why: a plate, kerf, extra gap or edge margin above 100,000 mm
  (the field is marked and the last good value stays in use); a file whose curves would be sampled into more than
  2,000,000 points, or a DXF that draws more than that many, isn't added; a DXF that expands to more than 250,000 items
  (blocks and arrays), or has a spline of degree above 11, isn't added; an SVG that repeats shapes through `<use>`
  more than 100,000 times isn't added; and coordinates more than 1,000,000,000 mm from the part's center (or not
  finite) make the file too large to add.
- A file's CSS applies only to that file, as in an SVG viewer: parts are measured apart from the page, so the
  page's styles (or those of a site that embeds SnugCut) don't change them, and their rules can't reach the page.
  `:root` rules still apply to the part; rules that need an HTML page around the drawing, such as `body rect`,
  don't match.

## Test cuts

`fixtures/test-cuts/` has small pieces for dialing in the kerf and the fit before cutting a real job. Red `#ff0000`
is cut and blue `#0000ff` is score; set any black filled marks to engrave or turn them off. Cut each test from the
material and with the speed and power you will use, because the kerf changes with all three. Set "Edge margin" and
"Extra gap" as usual, and keep the pieces the way they are drawn: set **Rotation: None** (True shape), untick **Allow
90° rotation** (Bounding box), or set each piece's orientation button to locked in the parts list.

| File | Size | What it tells you |
|---|---|---|
| `kerf-test.svg` | 20 × 20 mm | Whether kerf compensation gives parts at their drawn size |
| `fingers-inplane-a.svg` + `fingers-inplane-b.svg` | 50 × 30 mm each | How a finger joint fits, independent of material thickness |
| `box-corner-a.svg` + `box-corner-b.svg` | 53 × 40 mm each | How a 90° box corner fits in 3 mm stock |
| `slot-gauge-3mm.svg` | 64 × 24 mm | Which slot width your 3 mm stock actually needs |

### Kerf test (`kerf-test.svg`)

1. Enter your kerf. To measure it, cut a square with **Compensate kerf on objects** off and no kerf offset in your
   cutter's software, then use "Measure it from a test cut" under Kerf.
2. Cut the piece with **Compensate kerf on objects** off, and again with it on and the kerf offset in your cutter's
   software turned off.
3. Measure both with calipers (k = the kerf):

   | | Compensation off | Compensation on |
   |---|---|---|
   | Outer square | 20 − k | 20.0 mm |
   | Square hole | 10 + k | 10.0 mm |
   | Round hole | Ø 6 + k | Ø 6.0 mm |

   With compensation on, parts still too small and holes too big mean the kerf value is too small: raise it by the
   difference (19.96 mm → add 0.04). Parts too big and holes too small mean the kerf value is too big, or the cutter's
   software is also offsetting. The blue score line and the black mark stay as drawn. So does the 0.06 mm pin hole
   with a kerf of 0.06 mm or more (most kerfs), because it's narrower than the kerf; the download then names it in a
   notice. With a finer kerf it's compensated like the other holes.

### Finger joint (`fingers-inplane-a.svg` + `fingers-inplane-b.svg`)

Cut both pieces on one plate, lay them flat and push A's three 6 mm fingers into B's gaps. The fit depends only on
the kerf, not on the material thickness.

- **Compensation off:** about two kerfs of play in total is expected: each finger comes out half a kerf narrower on
  each side, and each gap half a kerf wider.
- **Compensation on, too tight:** lower the kerf a little.
- **Compensation on, too loose:** raise it.

Fingers grow and gaps shrink by the same amount, so the fit changes twice as fast as the setting: 0.02 mm less kerf
makes the joint about 0.04 mm looser.

### Box corner (`box-corner-a.svg` + `box-corner-b.svg`, 3 mm stock)

Fingers 8 mm wide and 3 mm deep, the way a box side is joined. Fit the two pieces at 90°: A's fingers on segments 1,
3 and 5 fill B's gaps. With the right kerf the joint is snug and the faces are flush. If the fingers stick out or sit
short, the material isn't 3 mm: check it with the slot gauge. The finger depth is drawn for 3 mm. For other stock,
open both files in a text editor and change every `50` in the path data (the x of the finger edges; the drawing is
53 mm wide) to 53 minus the thickness, for example `49` for 4 mm stock.

### Slot gauge (`slot-gauge-3mm.svg`)

Five open slots 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2 mm wide, marked by 1 to 5 score ticks under each slot. Push an offcut of
the same sheet into each one. The narrowest slot it still enters is the slot width to draw for this material and
machine, kerf included. Cut it with and without compensation to see how much the kerf changes the fit. With
compensation on and the right kerf, a sheet that measures 3.0 mm fits the 3.0 slot snugly.

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard**: every control can be reached with Tab and used from the keyboard; the drop zone opens the file picker
  with Enter or Space.
- **Display**: the light or dark theme follows the system setting, and the status animation stops when reduced
  motion is requested.
- **Screen readers**: the result of each run, confirmations and errors are announced. Warnings and errors also stay in
  the message list above the plates until dismissed, and confirmations stay on screen at least 20 s, and longer while the pointer is over them or focus is inside them (their
  Dismiss button or Esc closes them).
  Field errors and the kerf measured from a test cut are announced once typing pauses; the kerf compensation warning
  is announced when it is turned on.
- **Focus** stays in place when the parts list or the plates are redrawn, and open "Parts on this plate" lists stay
  open. Removing a part moves it to the next part, and Search more and Stop hand it to each other.
- **Plate previews** describe themselves ("Plate 1 of 2: 15 parts, 75% utilization") and have a "Parts on this plate" list
  with counts and rotations. The image is described by the same list whether it is open or closed. Pointing at a dashed
  outline with the mouse shows the part's file name and rotation; that is extra, for mouse users only: the list says which parts are
  on a plate, but not where each one sits on it.
- **Invalid entries** are marked (`aria-invalid`) with a message under the field that says what's wrong and which
  value is still in use. The kerf field and the "Compensate kerf on objects" checkbox are also described by their
  hints.
- **Windows high-contrast (forced colors)**: pressed toggles keep a visible state, the orientation icon is an open
  lock, wavy grain lines or a closed lock to match (grain and locked filled like a pressed toggle), the holes icon shows an empty or a filled hole, and part thumbnails and plate previews keep their tan plate
  behind the parts' own colors, so they stay visible in dark themes.
- **Contrast**: text, including placeholder text, meets WCAG AA in both themes. The borders of fields, icon buttons and the mode and unit toggles,
  the plate edge, the "no holes" icon and the guide lines on the plate previews are at least 3:1. Text buttons have
  faint borders and are recognized by their labels.
- **Structure and names**: headings for the panels, results and each plate; a main landmark; quantity fields have a
  visible "Qty" label, and every button has its own name ("Orientation of star.svg: grain, 0° or 180° only", "Download SVG, plate 1 of 2").
  The orientation button has three states, which `aria-pressed` can't express, so its name says the current one and a
  change is announced.
  Icons inside buttons are hidden from screen readers.
- **Zoom and narrow screens**: part names wrap instead of being cut off, and below 480 px each part gets two rows
  (name, then thumbnail, Qty and buttons) and the settings fields stack in one column, so nothing is lost at 320 px,
  400% zoom or with larger text spacing. With JavaScript turned off, the page says that SnugCut needs it.
- **Known gaps**: where each part sits on a plate preview is shown only in the image and the mouse tooltips. Target size isn't required at WCAG 2.1 AA: the mm / in buttons
  are 24 px tall. Report problems as a GitHub issue.

**Target:** WCAG 2.1 level AA, plus the Revised Section 508 requirements that WCAG doesn't cover: accessibility
documentation (602, this section) and keeping information visible with forced colors (302.2). The reviews'
findings are fixed, but conformance hasn't yet been confirmed with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA) or a full audit.
Section 508 points to WCAG 2.0 AA for web content, so meeting WCAG 2.1 AA covers it and adds a few newer criteria
(status messages, reflow, text spacing, non-text contrast, label in name). As web content that meets WCAG 2.0 AA,
SnugCut falls under the 501.1 exception, so the software provisions in 502 and 503 don't apply separately. The
authoring-tool provisions (504) are treated as not applicable: the SVG and DXF files SnugCut writes are cutting paths
for machines in fixed formats, not documents for people to read. The two standards don't conflict anywhere in
SnugCut.

Like the original reference apps, the page loads two libraries by script tag, `clipper-lib@6.4.2` (polygon clipping) and
`jszip@3.10.1` (zip download), plus Google Fonts. They come from public CDNs (cdn.jsdelivr.net, cdnjs.cloudflare.com,
fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com) **each time the page loads**, unless the browser has them cached. Those
requests show the CDNs your IP address and that the page was opened; your files never leave the browser. Without
clipper-lib the page can't nest and says so; without jszip only "Download all (.zip)" is missing, and each plate can
still be downloaded on its own; without the fonts the page falls back to system fonts.

A Content-Security-Policy allows only those URLs, so an imported SVG can't make the browser load anything else, and it
allows the page's own script only by its hash, so injected inline scripts and handlers don't run. Both library script
tags carry a Subresource Integrity hash, so the browser refuses a library file whose contents have changed.

The search runs in Web Workers built in the page (a `blob:` URL, the only kind the CSP's `worker-src` allows). The
workers need their own copy of clipper-lib: the page fetches the same URL with the same integrity hash (`connect-src`
allows that one URL), which the browser serves from its cache. A program using `lib/snugcut.js` passes that URL and hash
to `startWorker({url, integrity})`; without them the search runs on the page. Each worker uses memory for its own cache
of part pairs: on 120 mixed parts, four took about 300 MB more than one, which is why the pool is off by default. If no
worker can be started (an older browser, or a page embedding SnugCut with a stricter CSP), the search runs on the page
itself, as before.

The script tags and the CSP are kept in `app/index.html`; don't edit them in `snugcut.html`, which is generated. To
bump a library version, change its URL in the script tag and in the CSP (clipper-lib's in both `script-src` and
`connect-src`), set its `integrity` to `sha384-` plus the
output of `curl -sL <url> | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A`, and run `python3 tools/build.py`. The
build copies the tags and the CSP into `snugcut.html` and writes in the hash of its inline script (`app/index.html`
allows its own files with `'self'` instead).

## Embedding SnugCut in another page

SnugCut is built as a page of its own, and `app/snugcut.css` assumes it owns the document: it styles `html`, `body`
and bare elements such as `input` and `footer`, and sets its palette on `:root`. Loaded as is into another site, it
restyles that site, and the site's own palette loses to it. There is no separate stylesheet for embedding. To
embed the app, put the contents of `app/index.html`'s `<body>` inside one container, for example
`<div class="snugcut">`, and load a copy of `app/snugcut.css` rewritten this way:

1. Prefix every selector with the container, inside `@media` blocks too: `.panel h2` becomes `.snugcut .panel h2`,
   `input:focus-visible,select:focus-visible` becomes `.snugcut input:focus-visible,.snugcut select:focus-visible`,
   and `::placeholder` becomes `.snugcut ::placeholder`.
2. Point the page-level rules at the container: `*` becomes `.snugcut,.snugcut *`, and the `html,body` and `body`
   rules become `.snugcut` rules. The `body` padding (16 px at the sides, 20 px above, 40 px below) is spacing for a
   page of its own; keep it or change it to suit the host.
3. Move the palette onto `.snugcut`: both `:root` blocks, the one at the top and the one inside
   `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`. The host can then set any of its custom properties (`--accent`, `--bg`,
   `--fg` and the rest) on the container, in a rule that comes later or is more specific. Keep the dark block, or set
   the dark values yourself: the colors are chosen to meet the contrast minimums noted at the top of `snugcut.css`.
4. Leave `body` in front of the two `[data-mode]` rules and add the container after it:
   `body[data-mode="bbox"] .snugcut [data-only="shape"]`. `app.js` sets `data-mode` on `body`.
5. Rename `@keyframes pulse` and the `animation` that uses it, for example to `snugcut-pulse`, so neither name
   collides with the host's.

The script reaches outside the container in a few places, which the host has to allow for:
- it sets `lang` on the page's `<html>` and `data-mode` on its `<body>`;
- it finds its elements by `id` (`search`, `pool`, `plates` and others in `app/index.html`), so those ids must be
  unique on the host page, and it writes the unit into every element with the class `u`;
- Escape anywhere on the page closes its toast, which is fixed to the bottom of the window; the toast also has a Dismiss
  button, and it stays while the pointer is over it or focus is inside it;
- it saves its settings in `localStorage` under `snugcut.settings`, for the host's origin.

The host also loads what `app/index.html` loads: the two library script tags with their integrity hashes, the fonts
(without them the fallbacks in `--f-display`, `--f-body` and `--f-mono` are used), and `app/app.js` as a module, which
imports `app/strings-en.js` and `lib/snugcut.js` by relative path. The host's Content-Security-Policy has to allow the
same URLs as SnugCut's, and `worker-src blob:` for the search workers; without that, the search runs on the page.

## Library version and markers

`setVersion(v)` sets the version written into exports (`<!-- SnugCut v… -->` in every SVG, and the `999` comment that
opens a DXF with kerf compensation built in); the app passes its footer version. Without it, exports say `unversioned`. A plate exported with kerf compensation
carries a marker saying so, and `isCompensated(text, isDXF)` tells whether a file has one, so it isn't compensated
again on import.

## Library messages

`lib/snugcut.js` words every message it shows a person (import errors and notes, export notes) through a code and its
values, so a caller can supply its own wording. `setMessages(fn)` installs it: `fn(code, vars, english)` returns the
text, or anything other than a string to keep the English. Without it, the library uses the English in `MESSAGES`. An
error the library throws keeps the worded text as `.message` and also carries `.code` and `.vars`. Every message has a
`name` (the file or part name) unless noted. The app words them from its string table (`lib.<code>` in
`app/strings-en.js`), with the limits formatted for the browser's locale.

| Code | Values | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dxf.binary` | | an import is a binary DXF |
| `dxf.unreadable` | | an import isn't a readable DXF |
| `dxf.noUnits` | `units` (`"mm"` or `"in"`) | a DXF doesn't declare its units (note) |
| `dxf.tooManyItems` | `limit` | blocks and arrays expand past the item limit |
| `dxf.tooManyPoints` | `limit` | blocks and arrays draw past the point limit |
| `dxf.tooLarge` | `limit` (mm) | a coordinate is not finite or lies beyond the size limit |
| `dxf.splineDegree` | `degree` | a spline's degree is outside 1 to 11 |
| `dxf.hiddenLeftOut` | `count` | items on hidden layers were left out (note) |
| `dxf.skipped` | `skipped` (`[entity type, count]` pairs) | unsupported entities were skipped (note) |
| `dxf.nothingToCut` | `hidden` (count on hidden layers) | a DXF has nothing to cut |
| `svg.unreadable` | | an import isn't a readable SVG |
| `svg.tooManyPoints` | `limit` | curves sampled past the point limit |
| `svg.tooLarge` | `limit` (mm) | a point lies beyond the size limit from the part's center, or isn't finite |
| `svg.tooManyCopies` | `limit` | `<use>` copies past the limit |
| `svg.nothingVisible` | | an SVG has no visible shapes |
| `svg.nothingToCut` | | an SVG has no cuttable shapes |
| `svg.noClosedOutline` | | an SVG has no closed outline |
| `kerf.holeTooNarrow` | | a hole is narrower than the kerf (export note) |
| `kerf.markup` | | a part's kerf can't be compensated (export note) |
| `dxfOut.nothing` | | a part has nothing to write to DXF (export note) |
| `dxfOut.clipping`, `dxfOut.text`, `dxfOut.images`, `dxfOut.use`, `dxfOut.paint`, `dxfOut.markers`, `dxfOut.unreadable` | | that part of a part isn't in the DXF (export note) |
| `dxfOut.element` | `tag` | `<tag>` elements of a part aren't in the DXF (export note) |
| `dxfOut.fills` | none | filled areas are written as outlines (export note) |
| `search.workerFailed` | none | a search worker failed without a message of its own (ends "Nesting stopped after an error: …") |

Exported files themselves (`.` decimals, the `SnugCut v…` and kerf-compensation markers) never change with the wording.

## Workflow

`app/` and `lib/` are the source; `snugcut.html` is built from them, so it stays a single file you can double-click.
After editing the sources, run:

```bash
python3 tools/build.py
```

and commit the sources and `snugcut.html` together. `python3 tools/regression.py` then checks that the exports are
byte-identical to `develop`'s and that the QA workbook tests' expected results still hold. Every pull request and
every push to `main` or `develop` runs both `--check` commands
(`.github/workflows/checks.yml`), so a stale `snugcut.html` or QA workbook fails the check, and the regression itself
(`.github/workflows/regression.yml`), so a script error or an unintended export change fails it too. The split app (`app/index.html`) uses ES modules, so it only runs
when served over HTTP (for example `python3 -m http.server`, then open `/app/`), not from `file://`.

git-flow: `main` + `develop`; `feature/` and `bugfix/` branches off `develop` with PRs into `develop`; fixes during a
release go on `bugfix/` branches with PRs into the `release/` branch. Versions are
`major.minor.iterative`, optionally with a pre-release suffix such as `-beta`, shown in the page footer and in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md): major, minor and the suffix change only on request; the iterative number is bumped with
every change, and a suffix stays on until it is dropped (1.1.0-beta, 1.1.1-beta, …). Once dropped, a suffix comes
back only for a major rewrite of what the app does or how it works. The release steps (an efficiency review before cutting the
release branch, a blind review after) are in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).
